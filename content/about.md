## whoami

My name is **`Fayçal Mitidji`** a.k.a `d3vr`, I am a freelance programmer and web developer
with 10+ years of experience and I'm currently based in Algeria.

You can find me on {{< a "https://twitter.com/imd3vr" "Twitter" >}} and {{< a "https://github.com/d3vr" "Github" >}} or reach out via email at 
`{{< raw >}}<a href="mailto:hi@f3.al" style="text-decoration: none;">hi@f3.al</a>{{< /raw >}}`.

In this website, I'll be writing about and sharing whatever I find interesting
in the moment (mostly technology-related).

My interests include but are not limited to:
- Programming
- Automation
- Linux and FOSS
- Hip Hop
- 3D & Gamedev
- Music production
- Space exploration

Check out my [Now](/now) page to see what I'm up to these days.

## Why?

I've decided to launch a blog for a couple of reasons:

1. This website will serve as a reference for future me when I end
up having to solve the same problems again.
2. It's a way of giving back and *learning through teaching*. I've learned
most of what I know from the internet through people sharing what they had
learned, their problem solving approaches and different perspectives. It would
only make sense that I do the same.
3. I'm an alumnus of {{< a "https://www.facebook.com/openmindsclub" "Open Minds Club" >}} and I am a firm believer in its motto: `Ce qui ne se partage pas se perd` (Which roughly translates to: What's not shared will be lost).

## Q&A

**What's `f3.al` supposed to mean?**

It's an abbreviation of my name: Fayçal ({{< a
"http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=fejsal&voice=Nicole" "`/fejsal/`" nounderline >}}).

The inspiration for this came from the common practice of abbreviating long
names in software engineering (e.g: `i18n`, `l10n` [^1]).

**What do you use to build the website?**

I'm using the {{< a "https://gohugo.io/" "Hugo" >}} static site generator with
the {{< a "https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" "Terminal theme" >}},
deployed on {{< a "https://pages.cloudflare.com/" "Cloudflare Pages" >}}.
