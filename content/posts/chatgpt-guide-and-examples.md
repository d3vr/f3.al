## Examples
Now that we've got a good understanding of what ChatGPT is and a timeline that 
shows how we got here, let's have some fun playing around with âœ¨ ChatGPT âœ¨!

Before we proceed, please note I'll be copying the output I get from ChatGPT as
text here for better readability and accessiblity (instead of screenshotting
everything), I'll also share a link for each example on 
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/" "ShareGPT">}}. Here's the convention used for the
following examples:

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}The prompt I write, fully human-made text.{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}ChatGPT's output, machine-produced.{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

I might also use `[...]` to truncate ChatGPT's output if it's not necessary to 
clarify a point. Output tends to get long.{{<br>}}
Other than that, I will copy ChatGPT's output as is, unmodified.


With that out of the way, let's see the examples!
{{<br>}}
{{<br>}}
{{<br>}}

### Programming and Code-Related Uses {#programming}
ChatGPT has shown impressive capabilities when it comes to generating code,
explaining code, writing documentation and providing help debugging.

{{<image src="/assets/posts/chatgpt-definitive-resource/programming-and-code.webp" alt="Man typing in front of 6 computer screens" lazy="true">}}

{{<br>}}
Jump to:
1. [Generate a Bash script](#bash-script)
2. [Explain code and fix possible errors](#explain-and-improve)

{{<br>}}

#### Example 1: Generate a Bash script {#bash-script}
{{<a "https://shareg.pt/a9Hws5s" "See it on ShareGPT">}}
{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Make a bash script that takes a program name as an argument and checks if
there's a running process for it using pgrep
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}To create a bash script that takes a program name as an argument and checks if
there's a running process for it using pgrep, you can use the following code:{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="bash" noheader="true" >}}
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided a program name as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  # If not, print an error message and exit
  echo "Error: Please provide a program name as an argument."
  exit 1
fi

# Use pgrep to search for a running process with the given name
pgrep $1

# Check the exit code of the previous command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  # If the exit code is 0, that means a process was found, so print a message
  # indicating that the program is running
  echo "The program '$1' is currently running."
else
  # If the exit code is not 0, that means no process was found, so print a
  # message indicating that the program is not running
  echo "The program '$1' is not currently running."
fi
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}Save the code to a file named `check_program.sh`, make the file executable by
running `chmod +x check_program.sh`, and then you can run the script by calling
`./check_program.sh` followed by the name of the program you want to check. For
example:
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="bash" noheader="true" >}}
./check_program.sh bash
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}This will search for a running process with the name "bash" and print a message
indicating whether or not it is running.
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}
Okay that's a great start, however when you run this, if the program is running 
it also outputs the process IDs for the program. I also want the script to exit 
with a non-zero status code, let's see if we can get it to update the script to 
match our needs.
{{<br>}}
{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Thanks, can you also not show the process IDs if the program is running? And if
the program is not running, exit with a non-zero status code
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}To modify the script to not show the process IDs when the program is running
and to exit with a non-zero status code when the program is not running, you
can use the following code:
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="bash" noheader="true" >}}
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided a program name as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  # If not, print an error message and exit
  echo "Error: Please provide a program name as an argument."
  exit 1
fi

# Use pgrep to search for a running process with the given name
pgrep $1 &> /dev/null

# Check the exit code of the previous command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  # If the exit code is 0, that means a process was found, so print a message
  # indicating that the program is running
  echo "The program '$1' is currently running."
else
  # If the exit code is not 0, that means no process was found, so print a
  # message indicating that the program is not running and exit with a non-zero
  # status code
  echo "The program '$1' is not currently running."
  exit 1
fi
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}This updated script will not show the process IDs when the program is running,
and it will exit with a non-zero status code when the program is not running.
Save the code to a file named `check_program.sh`, make the file executable by
running `chmod +x check_program.sh`, and then you can run the script as before by
calling `./check_program.sh` followed by the name of the program you want to
check. For example:
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="bash" noheader="true" >}}
./check_program.sh bash
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}This will search for a running process with the name "bash" and print a message
indicating whether or not it is running. If the program is not running, the
script will exit with a non-zero status code.
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}
A little repetitive, but that sure gave us what we asked for!{{<br>}}
As you can see, with minimal effort you can quickly generate working scripts,
or at least get a very good starting point. I can see this being super helpful 
to avoid spending too much time on boilerplate code.
{{<br>}}
{{<br>}}

#### Example 2: Explain code and fix possible errors {#explain-and-improve}
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/Wv5EHK6" "See it on ShareGPT">}}

I wanted to test its capabilities in explaining code and helping out with
identifying possible issues and adding error handling. So I first asked ChatGPT
to write a python script:

{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Write a python script that fetches a popular quote form an API endpoint, it
then appends the quote to a file
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}Here is a python script that fetches a popular quote from an API endpoint and
appends it to a file:
{{< /diag-item >}}

{{< code language="python" noheader="true" >}}
import requests

# API endpoint for fetching popular quotes
QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.quotable.io/random'

# file to append the quote to
QUOTE_FILE = 'quotes.txt'

# fetch a quote from the API endpoint
response = requests.get(QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT)

# parse the response as JSON
quote = response.json()

# extract the quote text from the JSON object
quote_text = quote['content']

# append the quote to the file
with open(QUOTE_FILE, 'a') as f:
    f.write(quote_text)
    f.write('\n')

print(f'Successfully appended quote to {QUOTE_FILE}')
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}This script uses the requests library to make an HTTP GET request to the API
endpoint, which returns a JSON object containing a quote. The script then
parses the JSON response and extracts the quote text, and appends it to a file.

Note that this script is just an example and may not work as-is, since it is
not connected to a real API endpoint. You will need to provide your own API
endpoint and modify the script accordingly.
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}
I then copied the Python code, removed all the comments, started a new session,
pasted the code and asked ChatGPT to explain the code and add comments. 
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/lbVUznN" "See it on ShareGPT">}}

{{<br>}}
{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}I don't understand what the following python script does, can you add comments
in the code and also explain what it's doing?
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="python" noheader="true" >}}
import requests

QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.quotable.io/random'

QUOTE_FILE = 'quotes.txt'

response = requests.get(QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT)

quote = response.json()

quote_text = quote['content']

with open(QUOTE_FILE, 'a') as f:
    f.write(quote_text)
    f.write('\n')

print(f'Successfully appended quote to {QUOTE_FILE}')
{{< /code >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}This script uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to the
`QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT` which is a URL for a quote API. This API returns a quote in
JSON format, which the script then parses to extract the quote text. The quote
text is then written to the `QUOTE_FILE`, which is specified as `'quotes.txt'`,
using the `with open` statement in Python. This will open the file in append
mode, meaning that the quote will be appended to the end of the file. Finally,
the script prints a message indicating that the quote was successfully appended
to the file.

Here is the script with added comments:
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="python" noheader="true">}}
import requests  # Import the requests library

QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.quotable.io/random'  # URL for the quote API
QUOTE_FILE = 'quotes.txt'  # File to store the quotes

# Make a GET request to the quote API
response = requests.get(QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT)

# Parse the JSON response to extract the quote text
quote = response.json()
quote_text = quote['content']

# Append the quote text to the quotes file
with open(QUOTE_FILE, 'a') as f:
    f.write(quote_text)
    f.write('\n')

# Print a success message
print(f'Successfully appended quote to {QUOTE_FILE}')
{{< /code >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}

Yep, it perfectly explains what the script is doing.{{<br>}}
Now let's try and see if
it can help us identify possible issues with the code and maybe even implement
a fix for us?

{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Can you find any possible bugs in this code ? 
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}There are no obvious bugs in this code, but there are a few potential issues
that could arise. For example, if the `QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT` is not available or is
not responding, the `requests.get()` call will raise an exception, which will
cause the script to crash. Additionally, if the JSON response from the API does
not contain a `'content'` field, trying to access `quote['content']` will raise a
`KeyError`.

Here is a modified version of the script that includes error handling for these
cases:
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< code language="python" noheader="true" >}}
import requests  # Import the requests library

QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.quotable.io/random'  # URL for the quote API
QUOTE_FILE = 'quotes.txt'  # File to store the quotes

try:
    # Make a GET request to the quote API
    response = requests.get(QUOTE_API_ENDPOINT)

    # Parse the JSON response to extract the quote text
    quote = response.json()
    quote_text = quote['content']
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    # Handle any errors that occurred while making the request
    print(f'An error occurred while making the request: {e}')
except KeyError as e:
    # Handle cases where the JSON response does not have the expected format
    print(f'Invalid response from the API: {e}')
else:
    # Append the quote text to the quotes file
    with open(QUOTE_FILE, 'a') as f:
        f.write(quote_text)
        f.write('\n')

    # Print a success message
    print(f'Successfully appended quote to {QUOTE_FILE}')
{{< /code >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}

So it correctly identified troublesome code, implemented safeguards and added
descriptive error messages. Isn't that something!

### AI Art
Let's see if we can get ChatGPT to generate prompts that we can directly use to
generate AI Art using {{< a "https://midjourney.com/" "Midjourney" >}}.

{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Describe an image that shows a futuristic utopian city in vivid detail under
one paragraph
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}In the image, the futuristic city is bustling with activity as flying cars zip
through the air above gleaming skyscrapers. The buildings are sleek and modern,
with intricate architectural designs and vibrant, neon-lit windows. The streets
are clean and free of pollution, with trees and greenery lining the sidewalks.
People of all ages and backgrounds can be seen walking, talking, and going
about their business, giving the city a vibrant and diverse feel. In the
distance, a massive space elevator can be seen reaching up into the sky,
signaling the city's advanced technology and progress. Overall, the city exudes
a sense of prosperity, progress, and harmony.
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}
I then used that output on Midjourney v4:
{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}/imagine futuristic city is bustling with activity as flying cars zip through
the air above gleaming skyscrapers. The buildings are sleek and modern, with
intricate architectural designs and vibrant, neon-lit windows. The streets are
clean and free of pollution, with trees and greenery lining the sidewalks.
People of all ages and backgrounds can be seen walking, talking, and going
about their business, giving the city a vibrant and diverse feel. In the
distance, a massive space elevator can be seen reaching up into the sky,
signaling the city's advanced technology and progress --v 4
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

### Language Learning
ChatGPT can also be a great tool for learning languages and enriching your
vocabulary.

{{<image src="/assets/posts/chatgpt-definitive-resource/language.webp" alt="A robot and a woman in front of the Eiffel tower" lazy="true">}}

{{<br>}}
Take a look at this example ({{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/VXrlTau" "ShareGPT">}}):
{{<br>}}



{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}I'm trying to learn French, I have very basic understanding of the language. I
want to ask you questions in English and you reply in French using words a
beginner would understand, also provide the English translation just in case I
don't understand. Can you do that ?

ChatGPT is capable of so much more, and the examples shown here so far are
just scratching the surface of what it's capable of.{{<br>}}

#### Example 1: Write songs {#write-songs}
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/J7SI68l" "See it on ShareGPT">}}
{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Write a 1940s country song about the hardships of being a programmer
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}
In a time before computers were widespread,
When coding was a new and daunting task,
We sat and stared at lines of code all day,
Trying to make the machine do our bidding,
But oh, the hardships we faced back then.

We battled bugs and glitches all night long,
Our fingers cramped from typing on the keys,
Our eyes strained from staring at the screen,
But still we pressed on, driven by our dreams,
To make the machine bend to our will.

But oh, the hardships we faced back then,
With no Google to search for our answers,
No Stack Overflow to guide our way,
We had to figure it out on our own,
And oh, the hardships we faced back then.

But still we persevered, day after day,
Until at last our code was running smooth,
And though the hardships may have weighed us down,
We never let them keep us from our goals,
And oh, the pride we felt back then.

So here's a toast to all the programmers,
Who've faced the hardships and come out on top,
We may have struggled, but we never gave up,
And though the road was rough, we made it through,
And oh, the hardships we faced back then.

#### Example 2: Explain like I'm 5 {#ELI5}
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/UgHDTq0" "See it on ShareGPT">}}
{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Explain to me like I'm 5 years old how robots are made
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}Sure, I'd be happy to explain how robots are made! Here's a simple explanation:
robots are made by people called engineers using a lot of different parts. The
parts might include things like metal or plastic for the body, motors to make
the robot move, sensors to help the robot see or hear, and a computer brain to
help the robot make decisions. The engineers put all of these parts together to
make a robot that can do different tasks. For example, a robot might be able to
pick up and move objects, or it might be able to talk to people. It's kind of
like building a toy, but with a lot more advanced parts!
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}

#### Example 3: Summarize long text {#summarize}
I asked ChatGPT to summarize one part of Vannevar Bush's essay 
"{{<a "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" "As We May Think">}}}". 
{{<a "https://sharegpt.com/c/PhlBT6U" "See it on ShareGPT">}}

{{<br>}}

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Please give me a summary of the following text:
"Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new
instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have
increased his control of his material environment. They have improved his food,
his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him
partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have given him increased
knowledge of his own biological processes so that he has had a progressive
freedom from disease and an increased span of life. They are illuminating the
interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the
promise of an improved mental health.

Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has
provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make
extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the
life of a race rather than that of an individual.

There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that
we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is
staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other
workersâ€”conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember,
as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress,
and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial."
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}The use of science and new technology has improved human life by increasing
control over the environment, improving health and longevity, facilitating
communication, and providing a way to record and build upon knowledge. However,
the increasing specialization of research is creating a barrier to further
progress.

## Tips & Tricks {#tips-tricks}

Okay, now that you've seen plenty of examples that show the potential of 
ChatGPT, let's have a look at some tips and tricks that'll help you get the 
output you want.

{{<image src="/assets/posts/chatgpt-definitive-resource/magic-wand.webp" alt="Magic wand with a big star at the end" lazy="true">}}

{{<br>}}

### Output cutoff
The output produced by ChatGPT sometimes cuts off when it's too long, here you
can try saying: `continue output` or `continue where you left off` and it will
usually finish writing where it stopped.

### Getting better answers
If you don't get the result you expected, you can either press the `Try again
button` or send a new prompt to guide it into giving you the result you want.

### Get more details
When ChatGPT returns a list and you want more detail on one or more items, you can
always ask it to elaborate.

**Example:**
{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Give me a list of short helpful tips to improve my writing style{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}
1. Start by using simple, clear, and concise language. [...]

3. Use specific, concrete examples and evidence to support your points. This
   will help your writing be more persuasive and convincing. [...]
7. Don't be afraid to revise and edit your work. Writing is often a process of
   trial and error, and it's important to take the time to refine and improve
   your writing. [...]
10. Finally, remember that practice makes perfect. [...]
{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤” > " >}}Elaborate on 3 and 7{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}
1. Using specific, concrete examples and evidence to support your points is an
   important part of effective writing. This helps to make your writing more
   persuasive and convincing, as it shows that you have thought carefully about
   your argument and [...].

2. Revising and editing your work is an important part of the writing process.
   Writing is often a process of trial and error, and it's important to take
   the time to [...].{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

{{<br>}}

## Limitations
While the examples I've shown here are very impressive, it is important to 
keep in mind that ChatGPT does have some limitations:
- It can produce answers that sound plausible but are in fact incorrect,
    misleading or nonsensical. [^1]
- It might fail at seemingly simple logical questions, since it currently 
    doesn't have access to any source of truth. [^2]
- Answers are not always consistent. You can prompt it for something and it
    claims it doesn't know the answer, but if you try rephrasing your prompt
    you might get a correct answer.
- It can be verbose and repetitive, for example it will often remind you that
    it's a large language model trained by OpenAI:

{{< diag >}}
{{< diag-item prompt="ðŸ¤– > " color="true" >}}I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, so I have a lot of general
    knowledge, but [...]{{< /diag-item >}}
{{< /diag >}}

- While OpenAI has filters in place that limits the model's output, you might 
    still be able to get it to respond to "inappropriate requests" with the
    right prompt, or it might produce insensitive, unsafe or harmful content.
- You don't necessarily get the same answers if you use the same prompts.

## Conclusion
I think we've seen enough in this post to say AI has come a long way and is
proving to be very useful in various domains. {{<br>}} Will this (and
subsequent iterations of this technology) change the way we work forever? I
don't know, I think the long-term effects of this technology will become
apparent as more time goes by.

I would love to hear what you think of ChatGPT? Do you think this would be
useful for your work or other areas of your life? Let me know in the comments
below!
