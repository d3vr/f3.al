### {{< a "https://whatsonmubi.com" "What's On MUBI" >}}

- **Launch**: `June, 2020`
- **Stack**: `Python, PHP, MySQL, TailwindCSS`

A website that shows all the films that are showing currently on MUBI across
100+ countries. You can search and filter the data however you want to find the
films that are most interesting to you.

What's On MUBI was born when a friend of mine told me she tried MUBI via a VPN
and found out they had a different collection of films for different countries,
that's when I saw an opportunity to help out film enthusiasts out there
discover and enjoy more films with the same MUBI subscription they had.

I'm currently working on a major rewrite of the website addressing many
different issues and adding a bunch of cool features!
